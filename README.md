### Dymola, Survival-Shooter
Second project for Game Development made in Unity, Dymola features a 3d third person survival shooter game. 

#### Main components of Dymola include:
3 Unique monsters that randomly spawn around the map. The weight of the monsters are controlled by the "EnemyManager" script for better playability.         

3 Randomly generated powerups: randomized speed, invicibility, and damage modification. Also to include health regeneration. These all spawn at a random location at a time between 5 to 15 seconds apart.

3 Different type of guns, long-Ranged lowest damage, medium-ranged higher damage, and short-range highest damage.

Stamina bar that allows the player to zoom past enemies at the cost of 25% of the bar per go. Lasts for 1 second and replenishes a full bar in 20 seconds.

Damage immunity for 1.3 seconds after being hurt to give the player a chance to reposition themselves. Also, the attacker is immobile for 1.3 seconds in conjunction with the player's immunity.
